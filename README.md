# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Diwali-Sales-Data

Data Analysis or sometimes referred to as exploratory data analysis (EDA) is one of the core components of data science. It is also the part on the majority of the time which makes it extremely important in the field of data science. This repository demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis methods and techniques using Python. The purpose of the used Diwali Sales dataset has been taken from Kaggle since it is one of the ideal dataset for performing EDA and taking a step towards the most amazing and interesting field of data science. Good luck with your EDA on the used Diwali Sales dataset.

In this project, we conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python with the following dataset parameters: 'User_ID', 'Cust_name', 'Product_ID', 'Gender', 'Age Group', 'Age', 'Marital_Status', 'State', 'Zone', 'Occupation', 'Product_Category', 'Orders', 'Amount'. Utilizing these parameters, we performed a comprehensive analysis.

The steps done are importing the data, data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.  

**Key Findings**:
1. There are 11251 rows and 15 columns in the dataset.
2. The name of the columns, its data types have been identified.
3. In the data cleaning part the following steps have been done:
            • removing null values 
            • converted data types of columns
4. Checked if there are missing values present in the dataset.
5. In the exploratory data analysis, the following are the key findings:
            • We can see that most of the buyers are females and even the purchasing power of females are greater than men.
            • Most of the buyers are of age group between 26-35 yrs female.
            • Most of the orders & total sales/amount are from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka respectively.
            • Most of the buyers are married (women) and they have high purchasing power.
            • Most of the buyers are working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation sector.
            •  Most of the sold products are from Food, Clothing and Electronics category.

 **Conlcusion** : Married women age group 26-35 yrs from UP, Maharastra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics category.

**Project Learnings**
• Performed Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation.
• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn Libraries.
• Improved Customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups.
• Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.
